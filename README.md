Terraform Provider Installation

Terraform relies on plugins called "providers" to interact with remote systems and expand functionality. 
Terraform configurations must declare which providers they require so that Terraform can install and use them. 
This is performed within a Terraform configuration block.

    1: Install Terraform AWS Provider
    2: Verify Terraform and AWS Provider version
