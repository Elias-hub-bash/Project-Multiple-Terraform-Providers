Multiple Terraform Providers

Due to the plug-in based architecture of Terraform providers, it is easy to install and utilize multiple providers within the same Terraform configuration. 
Along with the already configured AWS provider, we will install both the HTTP and Random providers.

 1: Install Terraform HTTP provider version
 2: Configure Terraform HTTP Provider
 3: Install Terraform Random provider version
 4: Configure Terraform Random Provider
 5: Install Terraform Local provider version
